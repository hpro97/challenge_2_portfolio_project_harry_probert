# challenge_2_portfolio_harry_probert


## Description 

i built this project to have a fully funcitonal place to display my front end coding work, by building an HTML page from the ground up with an accompanying CSS file, i used a bootcamp mockup as a general guide for funtionality and implemented my own style and information. I created a navigation area with funtional links correlating to a grid and flexbox system to show an about me section and display my work, after ensuring functionality i added semantics to increase accessability, alongside media queries for further functionality. I added comments in both the HTML and CSS files to improve structure, and refined my own code with minimal impact to functionality and appearance. All this leading to a relatively tidy and intuitive place to display my work to potential employers.
